### Absurd CSS Framework for Absurd People

Hello guys, I'm making a responsive CSS Framework named TamvanCSS, it's an absurd CSS Framework made by an absurd person for the absurd people.

This Framework is a modular framework built with Stylus CSS Pre-proccessor. It's modular, so you can use the only part you need, instead of including all the stylesheets.

But, I also will making the non-modular version, for you who are too lazy to pick the modules you needed one by one.

---------------------------------------------------

### This framework consists of :

**1. Grid system**
**2. Typhography**
**3. Tables**
**4. Form**
**5. Buttons**
**6. Images**
**7. Responsive Utilities**
